# HPC Containers on bwForCluster JUSTUS

Welcome dear reader!

we are specifically aiming at scientists of TheoChem/TheoPhys of Ulm University to conceptualize well-working experimentation workflows for the future of computational research.
Here we put information about the experimental containerization support which is available for bwForCluster JUSTUS as of now.
The pages will develop while the technical environment evolves.
Follow it here and join as test user to ensure that the upcoming 2nd gen JUSTUS will best match your experimental needs!

These pages are for you if you...
* want to experiment with software containers on bwForCluster JUSTUS
* want a specific software running on JUSTUS and the software is available in a containerized format
* are responsible for installing and maintaining customized software installations for a group of scientists

These are the docs so far:

* Intro Software Containers - ABOUT TO COME
* Benefits of using containers - ABOUT TO COME
* Getting started with using singularity on your local PC: [install singularity and create your first custom container](./docs/INSTALL.md)
* Software containers on JUSTUS: [List of containers](./docs/CONTAINERLIST.md) currently available (updated occasionally)
