# HPC Containers on bwForCluster JUSTUS

Welcome dear reader!

These pages are for you if you
* want to experiment with software containers on bwForCluster JUSTUS
* want a specific software running on JUSTUS and the software is available in a containerized format
* are occasionally installing and maintaining customized software installations for a group of scientists

We are specifically aiming at scientists of TheoChem/TheoPhys to establish well-working experimentation concepts for the future.
Here we put information about the experimental containerization support which is available for bwForCluster JUSTUS as of now.
The pages will develop while the technical environment evolves.
Follow it here and join our testing and experiments to ensure the upcoming 2nd gen JUSTUS will better match your needs!

These are the docs so far:

* Intro Software Containers - ABOUT TO COME
* Getting started with using singularity on your local PC: [install singularity and create your first custom container](./docs/INSTALL.md)
* [List of containers](./docs/CONTAINERLIST.md) available on JUSTUS (updated occasionally)
